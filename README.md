Translating from C to Assembly (specifically Y86).
There are 8 files: 4 in .C files, and 4 .YS files (the assembly files).
Every Assembly file does the exact same thing as it's counterpart file in C.

This is just to show how to do simple things in C, and then
what they look like in Assembly.

Don't worry, there's nothing as fancy as playing with the stack and frame pointers.
