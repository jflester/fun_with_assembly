Translating from **C** to **Assembly** (specifically **Y86**).

There are 8 files: 4 *.C* files, and 4 *.YS* files (the assembly files).

Every Assembly file does the exact same thing as it's counterpart file in C.

Don't worry, there's nothing as fancy as playing with the stack and frame pointers.
